My Personal Portfolio Website using HTML CSS and Javascript
## 🎨📐 Portfolio Notebook — A Dual-Sided Designer & Coder Experience

Welcome to my interactive, animated personal portfolio — a **multi-page digital notebook** that uniquely showcases both my **design sensibility** and **coding expertise**. This project blends a handcrafted aesthetic with modern web technologies to deliver an immersive user experience that mimics flipping through a creative sketchbook.

### 📘 Concept & Inspiration

This project reimagines a traditional portfolio as an interactive **notebook**, where each "page" reveals aspects of my personality and skills. The site is divided into **two mirrored sides**:

* The **Designer Side**, reflecting my visual creativity and user experience focus.
* The **Coder Side**, showcasing logical thinking, programming abilities, and technical projects.

Each side has distinct content but is symmetrically structured, creating a narrative flow and visual balance.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧱 Multi-Page Navigation

* **Home Page**: Introductory animation with floating text and profile imagery sets the tone.
* **About Me Page**: Features custom hover effects, animated text entrance, and a circular profile image that expands and contracts on hover — offering a playful, tactile feel.
* **Designer & Coder Pages**: Each acts like a “notebook page,” opening via animated buttons labeled **"Peek Inside"** and **"Dive In"**.
* **Loader Animation**: Smooth transitions between pages simulate the experience of turning a notebook page.

### 🧠 Designer Page Highlights

* Emphasis on creative identity, design process, and visual storytelling.
* Animated headings, hover-zoom image areas, and stylized font choices (imported custom typefaces).
* Uses organic visuals, subtle textures, and hand-drawn effects to enhance authenticity.

### 💻 Coder Page Highlights

* Displays technical skills, featured projects, and software tools.
* Interactive hover states and clean syntax highlighting for code snippets.
* Demonstrates fluency in modern web development practices.
